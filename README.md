# ChessProject
a very messy semi-working chess app

use a emulator to make it work. 
I use Pixel_3a_API-30_x86 
any similar sized one should work

It's all really redundant because this is 8 months in progress and I didn't do any planning

just comment the stalemate function out (and any other related errors out). 

don't move the pieces too fast

it's buggy, so if it crashes, rerun it

good luck trying to understand the code, cuz i forget what everything means

it works on my computer, so if it doesn't work on yours, lmfao
